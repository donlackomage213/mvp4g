#summary Tutorial, examples, projects made with Mvp4g.

To help you understand the framework, Mvp4g comes with tutorials and examples. You can also check real projects to give you a better idea of what you can do with Mvp4g.

==Tutorial==
_These tutorials have been written for Mvp4g-1.3.1, they'll soon be updated to reflect new features available in Mvp4g-1.4.0_

[http://mvp4g.blogspot.com/2011/04/mvp-pattern-associated-with-event-bus.html Layout]: Learn how to create your first Mvp4g application and how to set/manage its layout.

[http://mvp4g.blogspot.com/2011/04/history-with-mvp4g.html History]: See how you can add browser history support to your Mvp4g application. Also read about history advanced feature to learn about [http://mvp4g.blogspot.com/2011/06/navigation-control.html how to control your user navigation], [http://mvp4g.blogspot.com/2011/07/hyperlink-navigation.html use hyperlink navigation] or [http://mvp4g.blogspot.com/2011/08/custom-place-service.html define your own place service].

==Examples==
TestMvp4g: A basic example to easily understand how the framework works. UML diagram of this example is available at [http://mvp4g.googlecode.com/svn/tags/mvp4g-1.3.1/examples/TestMvp4g/TestMvp4g_UML.png here] (thanks to Steffen Nissen)


EmployeeAdmin: The GWT `PureMvc` example (as shown [http://employeeadm.appspot.com/ here]) but implemented with the Mvp4g framework. This example also illustrates how to easily unit test the presenters using JUnit directly.


EmployeeAdmin with GXT: Same example as `EmployeeAdmin` but implemented with GXT using different approaches ([http://groups.google.com/group/mvp4g/browse_thread/thread/5ba8664afbbda1f7 see Mvp4g and GXT post]). It also illustrates how to do unit tests with EasyMock.

Mvp4gHistory: This example shows how history is managed thanks to a Place Service.

MailWithMvp4g: This example shows the GWT Mail example converted with Mvp4g. It illustrates how Mvp4g can be used with `UiBinder` and the Reverse MVP approach.

Mvp4gModules: This example covers pretty much all the feature available in Mvp4g (Code splitting, history, filters...).

You can test these examples thanks to the [http://mvp4gshowcase.appspot.com/ Showcase].

==Projects==
[http://code.google.com/p/santa-exchange/ Santa Exchange]: The web site lets users manage a gift exchange and send invitations via email to create a Secret Santa party. This project code is intended to provide a solid foundation for building other web sites in the future and to demo all of the features needed in an enterprise-quality software project using these technologies. The best part, this project is open-source. This great example is available thanks to Kenneth Pronovici.
